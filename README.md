# Shared Task in Evaluating Accuracy
Our shared task focuses on techniques for evaluating the factual accuracy of texts produced by data-to-text systems.   We welcome submissions of both automatic metrics and human evaluation protocols for this task.

As training and development data, we provide a set of generated texts which have been manually annotated to identify factual inaccuracies.  We will evaluate submissions to the shared task based on a separate test set of manually annotated texts, and will report recall and precision compared to the test set annotations of inaccuracies.   This will be reported both overall, and for different types of factual inaccuracies, including incorrect numbers, incorrect names, incorrect words, and contextual errors. 

The texts we use are descriptions of basketball games produced three different neural NLG systems, from box-score data.  The descriptions are 300 words long on average.

## Shared task schedule
* 15 December 2020: Shared task officially launched at INLG 2020
* 1 March 2021: Deadline for notifying us that you intend to participate in the shared task (please email   e.reiter@abdn.ac.uk )
* 15 June 2021: Submission of techniques (metrics and protocols).  We will release the test set (without annotations), and ask participants to try their techniques on the test set and give us results within 2 weeks.   We will compare the results against our gold-standard human annotations of inaccuracies, and compute recall and precision statistics.
* 1 August 2021: Results announced
* 20-24 Sept 2021: Presentation of shared task at INLG 2021 (https://inlg2021.github.io/)

For more information or to register interest, please email Ehud Reiter at   e.reiter@abdn.ac.uk

## Important Updates:
Please note that prior to the commits on Monday 22nd February, the line for S042 in [games.csv](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/games.csv) was incorrect (it referred to an incorrect game which is not part of the shared task).  There was also an issue with the GSML for S029.  Both of these have been fixed, but please make sure you are on the most recent version of this repository.

## What is in this repo
This repository contains a set of 60 accuracy-annotated texts for the shared task, some of which were extracted from https://github.com/nlgcat/evaluating_accuracy. 
* texts: the source [texts](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/texts) produced by neural NLG systems, which describe basketball box score data
* word_docs: word documents used in human experiments.  Page 6 includes the texts (same as in texts directory) and links which human subjects can use to get data about the games
* gold-standard markup list ([gsml.csv](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/gsml.csv)), which lists mistakes in these texts.  This is a comma separated file, with cells encased in double quotes.
* appropriate subset of Rotowire JSON: For convenience, we have included the file [shared_task.jsonl](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/shared_task.jsonl) which includes the lines from the Rotowire test set, for each of our annotated documents.
* game information ([games.csv](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/games.csv)): Information on the games we annotated to create the GSML.
* example annotation exercise ([example_exercise](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/example_exercise)):  An example annotation exercise to familiarize yourself with the task.

Data for all games is available at [Rotowire](https://github.com/harvardnlp/boxscore-data) (original Rotowire JSON data).  it is also available at [SportSett](https://github.com/nlgcat/sport_sett_basketball) (extended relational database).  Please note that SportSett currently does not included playoff games, but does provide much more information on regular season games.

### [games.csv](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/games.csv) columns
1. DOC_ID: The ID for the summary within our shared task.  These match the filenames in [texts](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/texts).
2. HOME_NAME: The name of the home team.
3. VIS_NAME: The name of the visiting team.
4. LINE_ID_FROM_TEST_SET: The line from the original [Rotowire](https://github.com/harvardnlp/boxscore-data) test set that this game came from.  Note that line numbers start at zero (position within the JSON file)
5. GENERATED_TEXT: The text that was generated by a neural data-to-text system using the data for this game.  This text has been cleaned by us to allow for error annotation to be performed in [WebAnno](https://webanno.github.io/webanno).  The most common example of this is names like "C.J." are replaced with "CJ" (for sentence boundary detection).  These generated texts are tokenized then joined by a single space.  This is what we annotated in WebAnno, and was used to generate the GSML.
6. DETOKENIZED_GENERATED_TEXT: The same as generated texts, but detokenized such that whitespace is as it should be in English.  This is what we gave to the Mechanical Turkers.
7. DATE: The date from the [Rotowire](https://github.com/harvardnlp/boxscore-data) JSON format.  MM_DD_YY.
8. BREF_BOX: A link to the box score and other statistics for the game, in [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com)
9. BREF_HOME: A link to the season schedule for the home team, in  [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com)
10. BREF_VIS: A link to the season schedule for the visiting team, in  [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com)
11. CALENDAR: A link to a calander for the month the game was played in (we provided this to Turkers for convenience).

### [gsml.csv](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/gsml.csv) columns
1. TEXT_ID: The ID for the summary within our shared task.  These match the filenames in [texts](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/texts).
2. SENTENCE_ID: The sentence number with each summary (starting at 1, comes from WebAnno).
3. ANNOTATION_ID: A global ID for the annotation (error).
4. TOKENS: The tokens which were highlighted as a mistake, joined by a single space.
5. SENT_TOKEN_START: The start token position within the sentence (starting at 1, comes from WebAnno).
6. SENT_TOKEN_END: The end token position within the sentence (starting at 1, comes from WebAnno).
7. DOC_TOKEN_START: Like SENT_TOKEN_START except relative to the document start.
8. DOC_TOKEN_END: Like SENT_TOKEN_END except relative to the document start.
9. TYPE: The category that was agreed upon by our annotators for the error.
10. CORRECTION: The correction given (if it could be substituted directly and be almost grammatically correct).
11. COMMENT: If a direct CORRECTION cannot be made without a major rewrite of the sentence, or if the CORRECTION needs clarification.

A note on CORRECTION and COMMENT: NAME and NUMBER errors are mostly corrections (they are easier to directly substitute), WORD and CONTEXT are mostly COMMENT.

### [shared_task.jsonl](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/shared_task.jsonl) details
This file is in the the same format as [Rotowire](https://github.com/harvardnlp/boxscore-data), except that each line contains a dictionary representing one game record.  This makes it easier to read than one massively long line.  Three keys were added:

1. shared_task_text_id: maps to our TEXT_ID above.
2. cleaned_text: the human authored (gold) text from the test set, cleaned as above.
2. cleaned_detokenized_text: the human authored (gold) text from the test set, cleaned and detokenized as above.

### [example_exercise](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/example_exercise)
In order to familiarize yourself with the problem, as well as the process by which our GSML was created, we suggest that participants annotate one text manually for errors themselves.  For this purpose, we have included an updated version of the qualifying task which we used to screen our crowd-source workers.  The [Example Annotation Exercise](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/example_exercise/Example%20Annotation%20Exercise.docx) file contains the instructions we gave to workers, an example annotated text, then a text for you to annotate yourself.  This is not a requirement, although we do think it is a very useful exercise to do, and should only take about 20-30 minutes.  We have provided our solution in the [Example Annotation Solution](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/example_exercise/Example%20Annotation%20Solution.docx) document.  This example exercise only differs slightly from that which our MTurk workers when they first started doing annotations for us.  Since then, we have made some minor clarifications to our instructions, it is these updated instructions which have been included here.

### SQL Query for SportSett to get game_ids from rotowire line numbers
Note that playoff games are not currently available in SportSett.  It will, however, give complete access to every regular season game, including the league structure and schedule.  All games in the shared task are regular season games.  

Pleas also note that some additional denormalized tables have been added to [SportSett](https://github.com/nlgcat/sport_sett_basketball) to try and make it easier to use.  You do not have to use this resource for the shared task, but it is available if you want to use it.  The generated texts used the original Rotowire corpus as their training input.  Links to statistics websites are also included in [games.csv](https://github.com/ehudreiter/accuracySharedTask/blob/main/games.csv)
