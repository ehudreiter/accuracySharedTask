## What is in this repo
This repository contains an initial set of accuracy-annotated texts for the shared task.  We will expand the size of this set.
* 21 texts produced by neural NLG systems, which describe basketball box score data for 21 NBA games.
* gold-standard markup list (GSML), which lists mistakes in these texts
* spreadsheet showing relevant pages on https://www.basketball-reference.com/ for the 21 games
* human-written summaries for the 21 games

Data for the games is available at https://github.com/nlgcat/sport_sett_basketball
